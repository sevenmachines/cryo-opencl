Creating filelist for CL
Have a non-directory at the top, so creating directory top_dir
Adding /home/niall/Projects/Eclipse/cryo-opencl/src//OpenCLManager.cpp to top_dir
Adding /home/niall/Projects/Eclipse/cryo-opencl/src//OpenCLManager.h to top_dir
Adding /home/niall/Projects/Eclipse/cryo-opencl/src//OpenCLPrint.cpp to top_dir
Adding /home/niall/Projects/Eclipse/cryo-opencl/src//OpenCLPrint.h to top_dir
Creating filelist for runners

123     runners         cpp=123


Totals grouped by language (dominant language first):
cpp:           3822 (100.00%)




Total Physical Source Lines of Code (SLOC)                = 3,822
Development Effort Estimate, Person-Years (Person-Months) = 0.82 (9.81)
 (Basic COCOMO model, Person-Months = 2.4 * (KSLOC**1.05))
Schedule Estimate, Years (Months)                         = 0.50 (5.95)
 (Basic COCOMO model, Months = 2.5 * (person-months**0.38))
Estimated Average Number of Developers (Effort/Schedule)  = 1.65
Total Estimated Cost to Develop                           = $ 110,420
 (average salary = $56,286/year, overhead = 2.40).
